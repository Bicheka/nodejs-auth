# Node Js Auth

This project is an early work-in-progress.

The goal is simple: **create a basic authentication template for Node.js apps** that developers can use as a starting point or modify for their own needs.

Right now, the project is still in the early stages and **a lot of help is needed**. The idea is to build something that makes setting up auth easier without having to rewrite everything from scratch each time.

## Purpose

- Provide a simple starting point for email/password and OAuth login
- Offer a basic structure that developers can copy, adapt, or improve
- Keep things minimal, easy to understand, and flexible

## Status

- Very early development
- Many features missing
- Open to contributions, ideas, and improvements
